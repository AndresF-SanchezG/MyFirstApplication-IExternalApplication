# MyFirstApplication-IExternalApplication

## Introduction

The Revit Api allows to developers interact and extend the functionalities of the revit Software.
In this exercise we will use IExternalApplication, which is an integral part of the Revit API.

The IExternalApplication interface allows developers to create add-ins that load when Revit starts and unload when Revit closes. These add-ins can execute code in response to specific events in the application lifecycle.
